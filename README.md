# Text_to_Morze_Code

Hey!
This is a simple text-to-morze-code converter.But, there is a little problem here.
So, when I decode the morze code I get from online morze code converter, it is working fine. However, when I decode the code output in this code, there is 
an extra '' in the list. It's happening after splitting the morze code into a list. I figured out that when the number of one set morze code passes 9, 
**''** is being added the list.I tried to remove it and it worked with the morze code output of the code. 
I do not understand why this is happening. I hope someone could solve this issue.
